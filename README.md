## Sensor Data Handling

### MPX5010DP - Convert Voltage to Differential Pressure

![mpx5010](images/mpx5010.PNG)

From the formula given by the part manual, we can calculate the differential pressure according to the voltage:

- Vs = 3.3Vdc
- ignore noise

```
P = (Vout/Vs-0.04)/0.09 = Vout/0.297-0.45
```

### DHT11 - Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

The temperature digital value returned from the DHT11 sensor is in Celsius. To convert it to Fahrenheit, we use the following formula:

```
F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32
```

## Respiratory Rate Controlling

The normal respiration rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute.

We set the range of the adjustable respiration rate as from 10 to 30 times per minute. It means each respiration takes 2 seconds to 6 seconds. We set the default resp rate as 20.

## I:E Ratio Controlling

I:E ratio refers to the ratio of inspiratory time:expiratory time. In normal spontaneous breathing, the expiratory time is about twice as long as the inspiratory time. This gives an I:E ratio of 1:2. 

The ratio is typically changed in asthmatics due to the prolonged time of expiration. They might have an I:E ratio of 1:3 or 1:4. Even longer expiratory times are required sometimes.

An inverse ratio refers to when the I:E ratio is 2:1 or higher and is typically used to ventilate non-compliant lungs. Pressure control modes of ventilation should be used when employing inverse ratios as the use of volume control modes might lead to breath stacking and an increase in airway pressure.

We set the default I:E ratio as 2:1. The ratio is adjustable within a set of ratios including 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4.
